        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: [INSERT DATE]</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Privacy First:</strong> Receipt Scanner is designed with your privacy as the top priority. All your data is stored locally on your device. We do not sell, share, or rent your personal information to third parties.
        </div>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>Receipt Scanner collects and processes the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Receipt Images:</strong> Photos you capture or upload of your receipts</li>
            <li><strong>Extracted Receipt Data:</strong> Store names, dates, item names, prices, and purchase information extracted from your receipts</li>
            <li><strong>Inventory Data:</strong> Item tracking and purchase history you create within the app</li>
            <li><strong>Shopping Lists:</strong> Items you add to your shopping lists</li>
            <li><strong>App Usage Data:</strong> Information about how you use the app (stored locally only)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Store Your Data</h2>
        <p><strong>Local Storage (Primary):</strong> All your receipt images, extracted data, inventory, and shopping lists are stored locally on your device using AsyncStorage. This data never leaves your device unless you use optional cloud processing features.</p>

        <h2>3. Cloud Processing (Optional)</h2>
        <p>Receipt Scanner offers two OCR (Optical Character Recognition) modes:</p>

        <h3>Local OCR (Default - Offline)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Processes receipts entirely on your device using Tesseract.js</li>
            <li>No internet connection required</li>
            <li>Images and data never leave your device</li>
            <li>100% private and secure</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cloud AI OCR (Optional - Online)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Uses OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision for superior accuracy</li>
            <li>Receipt images are sent to OpenAI's servers via encrypted HTTPS connection</li>
            <li>OpenAI processes the image and returns extracted text data</li>
            <li><strong>Data Retention:</strong> OpenAI retains data for 30 days for abuse monitoring, then permanently deletes it</li>
            <li>No personally identifiable information (PII) is sent with images</li>
            <li>You can disable cloud processing anytime in Privacy Settings</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When you enable cloud processing, you consent to your receipt images being sent to OpenAI for OCR analysis. You can revoke this consent anytime in the app's Privacy Settings.</p>

        <h2>4. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the collected information solely to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Extract purchase information from receipt images using OCR</li>
            <li>Organize and categorize your receipts</li>
            <li>Track your inventory and purchase history</li>
            <li>Generate spending analytics and reports</li>
            <li>Provide shopping list functionality</li>
            <li>Improve app functionality and user experience</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Important:</strong> We do NOT use your data for advertising, marketing, or any purpose other than providing app functionality.
        </div>

        <h2>5. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
